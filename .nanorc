## Nano configuration
##
## See the nanorc(5) man page for details. See also /etc/nanorc for more options.

## Use auto-indentation.
set autoindent

## Use bold text instead of reverse video text.
set boldtext

## The characters treated as closing brackets when justifying
## paragraphs.  They cannot contain blank characters.  Only closing
## punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets, can end
## sentences.
set brackets ""')>]}"

## Constantly display the cursor position in the statusbar.  Note that
## this overrides "quickblank".
set constantshow

## Set the line length for wrapping text and justifying paragraphs.
## If the value is 0 or less, the wrapping point will be the screen
## width less this number.
set fill -2

## Remember the used search/replace strings for the next session.
set historylog

## Have the justify command kill whitespace at the end of lines
set justifytrim

## The opening and closing brackets that can be found by bracket
## searches.  They cannot contain blank characters.  The former set must
## come before the latter set, and both must be in the same order.
set matchbrackets "(<[{)>]}"

## Use the blank line below the titlebar as extra editing space.
set morespace

## Enable mouse support, if available for your system.  When enabled,
## mouse clicks can be used to place the cursor, set the mark (with a
## double click), and execute shortcuts.  The mouse will work in the X
## Window System, and on the console when gpm is running.
set mouse

## Remember the cursor position in each file for the next editing session.
set positionlog

## The characters treated as closing punctuation when justifying
## paragraphs.  They cannot contain blank characters.  Only closing
## punctuation, optionally followed by closing brackets, can end
## sentences.
set punct "!.?"

## Fix Backspace/Delete confusion problem.
set rebinddelete

## Fix numeric keypad key confusion problem.
set rebindkeypad

## Do extended regular expression searches by default.
set regexp

## Make the Home key smarter.  When Home is pressed anywhere but at the
## very beginning of non-whitespace characters on a line, the cursor
## will jump to that beginning (either forwards or backwards).  If the
## cursor is already at that position, it will jump to the true
## beginning of the line.
set smarthome

## Use smooth scrolling as the default.
set smooth

## Enable soft line wrapping (AKA full-line display).
set softwrap

## Use this spelling checker instead of the internal one.  This option
## does not properly have a default value.
set speller "hunspell"

## Use this tab size instead of the default; it must be greater than 0.
set tabsize 2

## Convert typed tabs to spaces.
set tabstospaces

## The two single-column characters used to display the first characters
## of tabs and spaces.  187 in ISO 8859-1 (0000BB in Unicode) and 183 in
## ISO-8859-1 (0000B7 in Unicode) seem to be good values for these.
## The default when in a UTF-8 locale:
set whitespace "»·"
## The default otherwise:
# set whitespace ">."

## Detect word boundaries more accurately by treating punctuation
## characters as parts of words.
set wordbounds


## Paint the interface elements of nano.
## This is an example; by default there are no colors.
# set titlecolor brightwhite,blue
# set statuscolor brightwhite,green
# set keycolor green
# set functioncolor yellow


## Setup of syntax coloring.
include "/usr/share/nano/*.nanorc"

## Key bindings.
## See nanorc(5) (section REBINDING KEYS) for more details on this.
